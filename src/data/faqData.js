    question: "How do you guarantee product quality?",
    answer:
      "We evaluate the result after every two weeks, we test our work (we conduct both development and acceptance tests), we present it to you, we apply your feedback so you know you get what you are paying for."
  },

    id: 2,
    question: "How can I be sure you work at my project as much as you declare?",
    answer:
      "We thoroughly monitor our developers and control how much time they spend on each task down to the exact minute. We use Harvest software and Redmine to track time spent on your project."
  },

    question: "I want to be involved in the app development process, do you have a problem with that?",
    answer:
      "Not at all! We want you to be sure you'll receive the product you desire. From the planning stage to each finished version, we invite you to evaluate and improve our work. Our philosophy is to work with the client, not merely finish given tasks. We are always ready to listen and communicate."

    question: "What technology do you use?",
    answer:
      "For back-end we use Python, Django and Node.js. For front-end we use Angular.js, and React.js. For mobile we use Kotlin and Swift."

    question: "How do I create a product with you?",
    answer:
      "If you have an idea, contact us through our online form, e-mail, or phone. We'll meet and talk it over. Just be sure to prepare as much info about your idea as possible; it will smoothen the meeting and benefit further cooperation. If you don't know how to get around to it, go ahead and read our blog entry on how to write a project brief."

    id: 6,
    question: "Should I create a mobile or a web app?",
    answer:
      "Both have their benefits and flaws. Mobile apps are surely more expensive but can provide you with many more data collecting, monetization capabilities than web applications. Progressive Web Apps are a good compromise between a mobile and web appâ€”you can learn more about PWA on our blog. But remember that sooner or later you may need both a mobile and web app, and when that moment comes, we are here for you :)"
